This Modules folder has the terraform code that can be used to create a module and how we can implement that.
We just need to create a separate module or we can use the existing ones by giving the source of the module and then we will be passing all the required variable value's.

In this we need to pass 2 values :
1 - ami as ami_id
2 - instance_type as ins_type
